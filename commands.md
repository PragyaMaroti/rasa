1.  To start a new project: **python -m rasa init**
2.  To test a newly trained model : **python -m rasa nlu shell** : </br> we can interact with the command prompt and it gives output with the following contents: <br>
 - The intent the model thinks is the most likely match for the message.</br>
○ For example: {“name: greet”, “confidence: 0.95347273804” . This means the
model is 95% certain “Hello there” is a greeting.</br>
- A list of extracted entities, if there are any.</br>
- A list of intent_rankings. These results show the intent classification for all of the other
intents defined in the training data. The intents are ranked according to the intent match
probability predictions generated by the model
